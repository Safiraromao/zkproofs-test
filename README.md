# zkproofs-test

# zkProver Playground

🛠 This repository contains experiments and research on zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) and prover networks.

## 📌 About
This project explores the implementation of lightweight zk-provers for L1/L2 scalability and privacy.

- 🔒 **zk-SNARK circuits**
- ⚡ GPU-friendly proving
- 🌐 Integration with testnets

## 📂 Structure
- `src/` – experimental code
- `docs/` – technical notes
- `test/` – testnet scripts

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Safiraromao/zkproofs-test.git
